#### 25th May

* ~Set up temperature module~

* Characterise handling lysate. Create a script to try different parameters
and see the technical error. **We tried doing this by weighing pcr tubes before and after using the chemical balance but the volumes (~2.5ul doesn't weigh enough for the instument to capture the error. We have decided to proceed straight to the CFPS reaction and use variance between technical replicates as a proxy for pipetting error.** 





* Set up first lysate reaction with OT2
