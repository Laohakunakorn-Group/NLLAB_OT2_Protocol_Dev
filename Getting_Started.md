# Getting started

## Initial set up of the robot

First open the Opentrons application and turn the robot on. The blue light will
stop flashing and turn solid once the robot has paired with the computer. Once
it has paired the robot name should be listed and you can toggle it on. There
are a lot of settings that can be changed from the menus here.
