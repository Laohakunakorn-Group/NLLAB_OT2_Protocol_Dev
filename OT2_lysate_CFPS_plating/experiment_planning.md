# Intro

This document contains the experimental design, planning and technical decisions for the OT2 technical error reducing AL experiments.

# Premise

The aim is to use AL to optimise the technical error between replicates by modulating:

* Aspirate / Dispensing speeds
* Aspirate / Dispensing Pipette tip height  ** Looks like dispense volume is absolutely key for low volumes **
* Reverse pipetting


# Design

* 10x *E. coli* lysate + pBest reactions per each config set.
* We will use Michael's standard reaction composition.


# Initialising the settings

## Aspiration height

Using the information above:

2.5ul of lysate x 10 = 25ul
Adding a bit extra = 30ul.

The meniscus height of 30ul in a PCR tube is around 5mm above the bottom


# Experiments

## 1. Checking lysate pipetting in PCR Tubes

Pipetted 10x 2.5ul in to 10x PCR tubes at 4 degrees.

*still optimising*
**asp height: 4.7 untested** 

## Pipetting lysate into a 384 well plate
